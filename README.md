# 2.5D-basic-character-controller-URP
This is a basic character controller for 2.5d environment using the new input system.
In order for this to work you need to relace the child object of the player game object with up a humanoid character. 
This was created in order to help follow allong with my medium article "Creating a ledge climb system in Unity using the new input system"
There are several mixamo animaions attached and set up ready for the ledge grab system.
